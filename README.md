# Python Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also features sound effects, error handling, a clear button, and a backspace button for a better user experience.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **GUI**: Built using the Tkinter library with custom styling for a modern look.
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Error" when an invalid operation is performed and disables further input until cleared.
- **Sound Effects**: Plays a sound when any button is clicked, with a unique sound for the "=" button.
- **Clear Function**: Allows clearing the display for new calculations.
- **Backspace Button**: Removes the last entered digit.
  
## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd Python-Calc

3. Run the calculator script:

   python calculator.py

4. The calculator window will appear, allowing you to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Prerequisites
